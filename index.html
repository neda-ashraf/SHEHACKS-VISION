The peer to peer learning system with the mentor would boost up the desire to learn virtually making efficient usage of time.....<br>And for sure, this hack series would expand my opportunities outside of university work  and eventually help in building up my technical knowledge and experience, providing a better exposure. Thereby recognizing and embracing the true uniqueness of women over technology.

                <p><em>"SheHacks as a great platform for developing an inquisitive problem-solving mindset that is aided with skills and tools to develop a potential solution for any of the problems. It is an excellent opportunity to perceive my abilities, boost them and reach the pinnacle of my career trajectory. Working as a team will help me to unleash energy that boosts creativity, productivity, engagement, communication, and efficiency.<br> Since there is a gender gap existing in the field of technology, I think appropriate guidance from skilled mentors from the very beginning can help to bridge the gap. So, I am eagerly anticipating the 2-week long hack series."</em></p>
